In this interactive visual explainer, we delve into the world of PC gaming hardware trends during the COVID-19 pandemic and crypto craze, with a particular focus on graphics cards (GPUs). Using data from Steam's hardware surveys, we analyze the adoption of new and outgoing graphics cards, examine the impact of COVID-19 and crypto prices on GPU adoption, and provide insights into the evolving landscape of PC gaming hardware.

## CampusNet 🏫

C library 👉 [tunet-c - GitHub](https://github.com/robertying/tunet-c)

Windows UWP 👉 [.Net Campus - Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PDVWNT4K1MW)

Android 👉 [CampusNet - GitHub](https://github.com/robertying/CampusNet-Android/releases)

The campus networks in Tsinghua University have weird authentication methods. It has long been a pain for students to log in quickly and easily.

These utilities above can perform auto login when Wi-Fi changes and have a traffic usage chart.

To speed up development, I wrote a C library to deal with the authentication.

Keywords 🔑: UWP, Android, cURL, OpenSSL, NDK
