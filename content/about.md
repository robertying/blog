My name is **Rui**. I like to be called **Robert** as well. I was an undergraduate student of Electronic Engineering at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm). Now I'm beginning the journey as a Computer Science Master's student at Stanford University. I'm always enthusiastic about computer stuff and keen on software engineering, especially front-end development.

## Interests

My _biggest_ interest: Computers üíª

- Software development! Websites, apps, helper scripts...
- Cutting-edge software! Trying out iOS 15 beta and Windows 11.
- Game hardware! I have my own DIY PC setup.

## Life

### Before college

I was born in a seaside city in Zhejiang Province, China. Its name is [Ningbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningbo) which literally means _making peace with the sea_. So yes, there are large ports in my hometown as well as delicious seafood.

I spent 18 years there and finished my primary and high schools.

### College

Hard work paid off. I was admitted into the best university in China and was able to have three nice roommates along the college journey.

Although the college life is not what I expected, I've always tried to _live something good_ out of it. I decided to pursue my interest in **Computer Science** instead of Electronic Engineering in my third year.

I have also been excited about my exchange experience in [University of Utah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Utah). Salt Lake City is _quite a place_ to enjoy the life. But I was in too much a hurry and didn't have a chance to go skiing there. What a shame!

### Graduate

I was so lucky to be admitted into one of the world's top CS programs at Stanford University.

I should have been able to go back to the U.S. and start my Master's program in fall, but no one could have seen a global pandemic coming in 2020.
