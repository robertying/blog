My name is **应睿 (Ying Rui)**. I like to be called **Robert** as well. I'm currently an undergraduate student of Electronic Engineering at [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html). Though my major is Electronic Engineering, I'm _always_ enthusiastic about computer stuff and keen on software engineering, especially front-end development.
