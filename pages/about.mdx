};

My name is **应睿 (Ying Rui)**. I like to be called **Robert** as well. I'm currently an undergraduate student of Electronic Engineering at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm). Though my major is Electronic Engineering, I'm _always_ enthusiastic about computer stuff and keen on software engineering, especially front-end development.

## Interests

My _biggest_ interest: computers 💻 !

- Software development! Websites, apps, helper scripts...
- Use software! I like resetting Windows installations. 🙃
- Game hardware! I have my dear baby DIY PC.

Second best loved: Games 🎮 !

- Hmm... I don't play on consoles.
- World of Warcraft, Overwatch... Yes Blizzard ❄️ !
- Assassins' Creed Odyssey.

Also, Netflix, movies 🍿 and music 🎧 !

- Sci-fi, fantasy...
- _**`Lady Gaga`**_ !!!

## Life

### Before college

I was born in a seaside city in Zhejiang Province, China. Its name is [Ningbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningbo) which literally means _making peace with the sea_. So yes, there are large ports in my hometown as well as delicious seafood.

I spent 18 years here and finished my primary and high schools.

### College

Quite luckily, I was admitted into the best university in China and was able to have three nice roommates along the college journey.

Though life is not what I expected, I've always tried to _live something good_ out of it. I decided to pursue my interest in **Computer Science** instead of Electronic Engineering. I hope I can get what I want soon. 😎

I'm also excited about my exchange experience in [University of Utah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Utah). Salt Lake City is _quite a place_ to enjoy the life. But I was in too much a hurry and didn't have a chance to go skiing there. What a shame!

### Graduate

I was so lucky to be admitted into one of the world's top CS programs at Stanford University.

I should have been able to go back to the U.S. and start my Master's program in fall, but no one could have seen a global pandemic coming in 2020.
