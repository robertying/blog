Here are some projects I have been working on out of great interest or personal needs. All are independent work.

## learnX ✨

👉 [learnX](https://github.com/robertying/learnX)

Hybrid app for Tsinghua University Web Learning, written with React Native 💖, making it much easier to browse your course notices, download files and review your homework.

Keywords 🔑 React Native, TypeScript, Hybrid App

## EESAST 📰

👉 [EESAST](https://eesast.com/)

This is the official site for EESAST, _**Student Association of Science and Technology**_, of my university department.

Keywords 🔑 React, Node, Ant Design, Full Stack

## CampusNet series 🏫

Windows UWP 👉 [.Net Campus](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PDVWNT4K1MW)

Android 👉 [CampusNet](https://github.com/robertying/CampusNet-Android/releases)

C library 👉 [tunet-c](https://github.com/robertying/tunet-c)

The campus networks here in Tsinghua have weird authentication methods. It has long been a pain for students to log in quickly and easily.

These utilities above can perform auto login when Wi-Fi changes and have a traffic usage chart.

To fasten development, I wrote a C library to deal with the authentication.

Keywords 🔑 UWP, Android, cURL, OpenSSL, NDK

## Others 📦

There is also an information managing website built for students' related stuff of my department, written in React.

Some handy scripts and ongoing projects...
